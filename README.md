# AminoPredict
Basic tool for amino acid / protein translation, 
yet AminoPredict accepts both RNA and DNA as input and, 
can predict their entire possible chronological sequence. 
More refinements should hopefully be coming soon!
such as:

- Incorporating and initialising all methods through classes
- Reverse list prediction 
- Accounting for each stop and start codons.
- Generating all specific peptides
- Calculating allignment scores
- Folding 
- Three dimentional illustration of the folding simulation (With GridMod)
